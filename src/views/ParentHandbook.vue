              <p>Our goal is to create open lines of communication right from the beginning. Please tell us everything you can think of that will help your child thrive at The TreeHouse. We want to hear your comments and concerns, and promise to use your thoughts to help us create a more perfect atmosphere for everyone at the center. Children 18 months and under will go home each day with a note outlining their day including daily activities, temperament, and food ins and outs. Parents may request this same type of note for children over 18 months. Teachers will try to relay the child’s high’s and low’s to the parent at pick up time.</p>
              <p>Please let us know if there are major events occurring in the family, such as a sudden death in the family, divorce, or moving, as these events often result in a different temperament in your child. Sometimes this can be a very scary (or exciting) time for your child, our staff is trained in helping children express these emotions in socially acceptable ways without even mentioning the event.</p>

              <p>A trained staff member will handle all behavior concerns. If a minor issue occurs the trained staff member (not the teacher in charge of the class) will join the child and review rules and expectations for the school. If behaviors continue a PBS plan will be created specifically for that child. Parents will be involved in all aspects of the PBS plan. We do not send children to “time out” unless it is preplanned as part of their PBS plan as we do not feel it is an effective way to teach young children appropriate ways to communicate and socialize. We always look for alternative ways to say, “No.” We do this by offering choices and turning what they want to do into an acceptable activity. We pride ourselves on having open lines of communication between parents and teachers, so please don’t hesitate to talk to us regarding any concerns or comments you have.</p>

              <dl>
                <li>Diarrhea</li>
                <li>Vomiting 2 or more times within a 24 hour period. (Please do not bring your child to the center if they have vomited during the night.)</li>

              <p>We make every effort to keep all of our surfaces sanitized and sterile and we have a regular routine for washing hands and keeping noses clean. You can help us keep illnesses out of the TreeHouse too by not bringing your child to the center when they are sick.</p>
              <p>Please inform us in writing of any medication that the child needs to take during the day. Forms will be available at the front desk. Please give the note and medication to a staff member, do not leave it in the child’s bag or backpack.</p>
